- 1/21/19 - I've completed the bulk of the Genetic Algorithm. The only remaining piece is the fitness function 
            but this area lies in the Neural Network side of things. I've begun to fiddle with Neanderthal and
            would like to integrate it soon.
  - Next Steps
    1. Get a Hello world of Neanderthal running.
    2. Split the Neural Network and GA into their own files. Learn about Clojure namespaces in the process.
    3. Begin thinking about how to build test video files.
    4. Begin thinking about how you might create a visualization or further your test coverage.
